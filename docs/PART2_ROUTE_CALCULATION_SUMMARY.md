# Part 2: Optimal Route Calculation - Project Summary

## üéØ **Project Overview**

This project implements a comprehensive route calculation system using Dijkstra's algorithm that integrates with flood risk data from Part 1. The system treats the road network as a graph where intersections are nodes and road segments are edges, with costs determined by flood risk predictions.

## üìä **System Architecture**

### **Core Components:**

1. **Graph Creation**
   - Road intersections as nodes (vertices)
   - Road segments as edges (connections)
   - Dynamic cost calculation based on flood risk data
   - Support for multiple cost functions

2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation**
   - Priority queue-based shortest path finding
   - Handles disconnected graph components
   - Automatic closest node finding for invalid coordinates
   - Comprehensive path reconstruction

3. **Cost Functions**
   - **Distance**: Pure geometric distance
   - **Safety**: Inverted safety probability (higher safety = lower cost)
   - **Combined**: Distance + safety cost
   - **Flood Risk**: Flood risk as primary cost factor

## üîß **Key Features**

### **Graph Analysis:**
- **2,183 connected components** identified

```

## üìà **Performance Results**

### **Sample Route Analysis:**
- **Total Distance**: 27.63 meters
- **Average Safety**: 0.000 (very low safety - high flood risk)
- **Number of Segments**: 2
- **Graph Exploration**: 4 nodes explored
- **Path Reconstruction**: 3 nodes in final path

### **Strategy Comparison:**
| Strategy | Distance | Safety | Cost |
|----------|----------|--------|------|
| Distance | 27.6m | 0.000 | 27.63 |
| Safety | 27.6m | 0.000 | 2000.00 |
| Combined | 27.6m | 0.000 | 2027.63 |
| Flood Risk | 27.6m | 0.000 | 20002.76 |

## üîç **Technical Implementation**

### **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**
```python
def dijkstra_shortest_path(self, start: str, end: str):
    # Initialize distances and previous nodes
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in self.graph.nodes()}
    previous = {node: None for node in self.graph.nodes()}
    distances[start] = 0
    
    # Priority queue: (distance, node)
    pq = [(0, start)]
    visited = set()
    
    while pq:
        current_dist, current_node = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        if current_node in visited:
            continue
            
        visited.add(current_node)
        
        if current_node == end:
            break
        
        # Explore neighbors
        for neighbor in self.graph.neighbors(current_node):
            if neighbor in visited:
                continue
            
            edge_data = self.graph[current_node][neighbor]
            edge_weight = edge_data['weight']
            new_dist = current_dist + edge_weight
            
            if new_dist < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = new_dist
                previous[neighbor] = current_node
                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_dist, neighbor))
    
    # Reconstruct path
    path = []
    current = end
    while current is not None:
        path.append(current)
        current = previous[current]
    path.reverse()
    
    return path, distances[end], path_details
```

### **Cost Function Implementation:**
```python
def calculate_edge_weight(self, segment_id, distance, cost_function):
    if cost_function == 'distance':
        return distance
    elif cost_function == 'safety':
        safety_prob = self.safety_weights.get(segment_id, 0.5)
        return (1.0 - safety_prob) * 1000
    elif cost_function == 'combined':
        safety_prob = self.safety_weights.get(segment_id, 0.5)
        safety_cost = (1.0 - safety_prob) * 1000
        return distance + safety_cost
    elif cost_function == 'flood_risk':
        safety_prob = self.safety_weights.get(segment_id, 0.5)
        flood_risk = 1.0 - safety_prob
        return flood_risk * 10000 + distance * 0.1
```
