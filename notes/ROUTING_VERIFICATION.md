# Sheltr Routing System Verification

## ✅ Road-Based Navigation Confirmed

### Current Implementation Status

The Sheltr backend is **already configured** to use actual road geometries for navigation, not straight lines.

### How It Works

1. **Road Segment Data**
   - File: `data/segments_safe_min_dedup.geojson`
   - Contains: 2,276 road segments with actual curved geometries
   - Format: MultiLineString geometries in EPSG:32651 (UTM Zone 51N)
   - Each segment includes:
     - `HubName`: Unique segment identifier
     - `pred_safe`: Safety prediction (0 or 1)
     - `pred_prob_safe`: Safety probability (0.0 to 1.0)
     - `geometry`: Actual road shape with multiple coordinate points

2. **Route Calculation Process**
   - Uses graph-based pathfinding (Dijkstra's algorithm)
   - Navigates through connected road segments
   - Considers safety scores and flood risk
   - Follows actual road network topology

3. **Geometry Extraction** (Lines 350-399 in `sheltr_backend.py`)
   ```python
   # Extract actual road geometries from segments for curved paths
   if segments_geometries is not None and 'path_details' in route:
       for segment in route['path_details']['segments']:
           # Find geometry for this segment
           matching_geoms = segments_geometries[segments_geometries['HubName'] == segment_id]
           
           if len(matching_geoms) > 0:
               geom = matching_geoms.iloc[0].geometry
               # Extract coordinates from MultiLineString or LineString
               # Converts from UTM to lat/lng for display
   ```

4. **Coordinate Point Extraction**
   - For a 7-segment route: Extracted **14 coordinate points**
   - For a 145-segment route: Extracted **329 coordinate points**
   - For a 108-segment route: Extracted **264 coordinate points**
   
   These multiple points per segment create curved paths that follow actual roads.

### Recent Console Output Confirms

```
Route found with 145 nodes
Segments geometries available: True
Path details available: True
Number of segments in path: 145
Extracting geometries for 145 segments
Extracted 329 coordinate points
Generated 47 turn-by-turn directions
```

### What This Means

✅ **Routes follow actual roads** (not straight lines)
✅ **Paths curve around buildings and obstacles** (using MultiLineString geometries)
✅ **Navigation follows street network** (graph-based routing)
✅ **Turn-by-turn directions generated** (based on actual road segments)

### Example Route Geometry

A single road segment can have multiple coordinate points:
```json
{
  "HubName": "1279572642",
  "geometry": {
    "type": "MultiLineString",
    "coordinates": [
      [290110.449, 1634159.671],
      [290125.242, 1634163.095],
      [290133.362, 1634164.430],
      [290142.011, 1634164.587],
      [290180.089, 1634161.037],
      // ... 9 more points creating a curved path
    ]
  }
}
```

### Verification

The system is working as intended. Routes:
- Navigate through the road network graph
- Extract actual geometries from GeoJSON
- Display curved paths on the map
- Generate accurate turn-by-turn directions

**No changes needed** - the routing system already uses road segments and avoids straight-line paths.
